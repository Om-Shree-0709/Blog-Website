    slug: "the-power-of-modern-javascript",
    excerpt:
      "Modern JavaScript (ES6+) has revolutionized the way developers build applications. With features like arrow functions, async/await, modules, and destructuring, JavaScript has become more expressive and readable. These enhancements not only improve developer productivity but also make codebases easier to maintain and scale. As web applications grow more complex, mastering modern JavaScript is essential for creating high-performance, robust, and future-proof solutions.",

    excerpt:
      "Accessibility is no longer optional â€” it is a core requirement for modern web design. Inclusive design ensures that digital products are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. By following principles like sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigability, and proper semantic HTML, designers can create interfaces that are both elegant and empowering. Prioritizing accessibility reflects empathy and broadens your audience, making the web a better place for all.",

    slug: "building-scalable-front-end-architectures",
    excerpt:
      "Creating scalable front-end applications is a vital challenge for modern developers. As applications grow, a solid architecture helps maintain code quality and ensures smooth collaboration across teams. Techniques like component-driven development, modular design, and effective state management (with tools like Redux or Zustand) are key. By investing in scalable architectures early, developers can build robust, maintainable systems that adapt easily to new features and evolving business needs.",
